### Inova Tecnologias

#### IT Manager - 2013/04 – Current

Fortunately, I had the opportunity to work alongside with great team members and we did awesome stuff together. Responsible for Devops and Engineering Team I’ve accumulated functions since I had never let the terminal go.

Look for new business and partnership opportunities, getting better contracts, maintain ~400k hosting users and dozens of dedicated services, understand company and customer problems to create appropriate roadmaps, prioritize tickets based on meetings with the support team, manage government projects and do some code it’s just a few of my duties. Below a couple of things we’ve accomplished;

- Coordinate datacenter migration moving 200TB and 150 production vms within 128 public IPs, 3k domains(only 80% managed by us) with less than 4 hours and 1 minor issue felt by the users.
- We’ve worked alongside Zimbra to help them fix several performance bugs impacting customers;
- Increase the customer satisfaction from 70% on avg. to 90%-98% over technical operations;

As IT Specialist I’ve led and executed the biggest success cases of the company.
