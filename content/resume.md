## Experience

### GetYourGuide AG

#### Site Reliability Engineer - 2018/12 - Current

_TODO_

### Inova Tecnologias

#### Engineering Manager - 2013/04 – 2017/12

Fortunately, I had the opportunity to work alongside with great team members and we did awesome stuff together. Responsible for Devops and Engineering Team I’ve accumulated functions since I had never let the terminal go.

Look for new business and partnership opportunities, getting better contracts, maintain ~400k hosting users and dozens of dedicated services, understand company and customer problems to create appropriate roadmaps, prioritize tickets based on meetings with the support team, manage government projects and do some code it’s just a few of my duties. Below some of things we’ve accomplished

-   Coordinate datacenter migration moving 200TB and 150 production vms within 128 public IPs, 3k domains(only 80% managed by us) with less than 4 hours and 1 minor issue felt by the users.
-   We’ve worked alongside Zimbra to help them fix several performance bugs impacting customers
-   Increase the customer satisfaction from 70% on avg. to 90%-98% over technical operations
-   Increased service availability from 95% in 2013 to 99.98-100% during 2014 and 2015
-   Migrated 100k users from dedicated and big customers to AWS avoiding datacenter infrastructure investments in 2014 and 2015
-   Established AWS technology partnership and ingressed in the fast track program getting marketing, poc and training funding.
-   Established AWS consulting partnership starting a new business for the company offering AWS managed services for customers
-   Earned the AWS Innovation Partner Award 2015 by helping customers migrate their data to AWS
-   Design, architecture and development of a new customer/reseller portal from ground up. This replaces the legacy portal with several ‘won’t fix bugs’ with new technologies and integrated with all services offered by the company
-   Fully automated config files, security updates with Puppet
-   Log archive project with Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana and Amazon S3 for government law requirements
-   Built Ops and Business KPIs using Datadog
-   Spread the culture of microservices and containers for the team
-   Delivered ~50 government projects with 100% satisfaction and mostly on-time since 2013 accumulating almost 1 MM migrated users from dozens of different platforms

#### System Administrator - 2010/10 – 2013/03

As IT Specialist I’ve led and executed the biggest success cases of the company. For my commitment within every project I got the opportunity to become Manager later I’ve accumulating a whole set of different skills. Virtualization and storage technologies, performance driven best practices, monitoring, development and automation was things often seen during this period.

-   Migration of the Email Platform of OAB-SP – Lawyers Association of Brazil – SP.
-   100k users, total of 5TB of data
-   Team: PM – 1 Engineer: Me
-   Several automation process including distribution of ssh certificates based on LDAP policies across all the 150 vms. It was a nightmare before that
-   Migration of the Email Platform of University of Sao Paulo.
-   240k users between students, professors and employees, 12TB
-   Team: PM – 1 Engineer: Me
-   Extension of the project above
