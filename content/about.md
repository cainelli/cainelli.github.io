# About

I'm glad you're curious, my name is Fernando as you should already know, I was born and raised in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and I live in Switzerland. I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at [GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.com/) and I am passionate about cloud native technologies. I enjoy coding (mostly in Go lately), to solve interesting problems and to learn. In my free time, I like to travel, listen to tech podcasts, to cook (Italian food is my specialty), to hike, ski, dive, and to play [viola caipira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_caipira).
